# Minor-JS-projects
A single repository with a plethora of small Javascript projects. Its is meant as a testground for my JS learning.

All projects, from newest to oldest:

## Blurry loading:

A small project where I make a page loading counter who dynamically changes and alters the blur applied on the page. Meant as a way to learn basic DOM manipulation and dinamycally styling. Project idea from Brad Traversy "50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript" course.


## Expanding cards:
A small project where I select one of five cards to get a bigger flex basis. Meant as a way to learn basic DOM manipulation and usage of event listeners. Project idea from Brad Traversy "50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript" course.
