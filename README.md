# Minor-JS-projects
A single repository with a plethora of small Javascript projects. Its is meant as a testground for my JS learning.

All projects, from newest to oldest:

## Form Validator:

Made a client side form validator for a "Register Here" page. It checks some parameters and shows custom error messages to the user. Note that it was meant as a way to understand basic validation and doesn't have any backend. Meant as a way to learn basic DOM manipulation, basic validation and dinamycally styling. Completed on 05/10/2021.

## Blurry loading:

A small project where I make a page loading counter who dynamically changes and alters the blur applied on the page. Meant as a way to learn basic DOM manipulation and dinamycally styling. Project idea from Brad Traversy "50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript" course. Completed on 30/09/2021.
